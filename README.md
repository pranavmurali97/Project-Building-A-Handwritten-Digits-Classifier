# Project-Building-A-Handwritten-Digits-Classifier
Using Python, we classify patterns into categories using 'Handwritten Digits Classifier'. We explore image classification using traditional machine learning models as well. For better accuracy, we test, train and improve a few deep neural networks for image classification.
